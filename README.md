# **Real-Time Yellow Object Detection Using OpenCV**  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **real-time object detection system** that identifies yellow objects using **OpenCV** and **Pillow (PIL)**. The system captures video from a webcam, processes each frame, and detects yellow objects based on **HSV color thresholds**. A bounding box is drawn around the detected objects, providing real-time tracking.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🎥 **Real-time video processing** using OpenCV  
- 🎯 **Color-based object detection** (detecting yellow objects)  
- 🖼️ **HSV color space thresholding** for accurate detection  
- 🔲 **Bounding box visualization** around detected objects  
- ⏳ **Efficient and lightweight implementation**  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **Pillow (PIL)**  

## 📌 Installation  
1. **Clone the repository**
